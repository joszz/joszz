## Hi I'm Jos
### Software developer, OpenSource enthusiast & Tweaker

I'm a full stack developer with a particular interest in design and user experience.

I decided I had earned the monicker of full stack developer, after having developed for many different environments, languages, and domains for about 15 years now :)

When I have some spare time (which is quite rare these days), I blog about some of the tech related topics I'm interested in or run into. [Check out my website GotGeeks.nl](https://gotgeeks.nl)
