## Hi I'm Jos
### Software developer, OpenSource enthusiast & Tweaker

I'm a full stack developer with a particular interest in design and user experience.

I decided I had earned the monicker of full stack developer, after having developed for many different environments, languages, and domains for about 15 years now :)

When I have some spare time (which is quite rare these days), I blog about tech related topics I'm interested in. [Check out my website GotGeeks.nl](https://gotgeeks.nl).

If I don't blog, I work on some of my personal projects you can find in my repositories.
The project I'm still very actively developing is Chell PHP Portal. 

I'm still looking for testers with sufficient knowledge of the used software stack, e.g. being able to setup an Apache site on Linux, doing some light database work etc.
Also any help on development is welcome. Documentation is scarce and currently setting things up requires some knowledge.
